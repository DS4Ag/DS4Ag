### Luis Vargas Rojas

I’m a PhD candidate in Agronomy at Purdue University. My background is in crop research and data science, with a focus on wheat and soybean phenotyping, field trials, and crop modeling—especially for drought and heat stress.

Most of my work involves building tools and workflows that make data collection and analysis easier for plant science.

**Skills**

- Python, R, SQL
- Data analysis and workflow automation
- Crop modeling and simulation
- Remote and proximal sensing 

**About Me**
I enjoy collaborating on open-source projects, teaching data science, and finding practical solutions for research challenges. If you’re interested in crop modeling, data pipelines, or just want to swap ideas about making plant science research more reproducible, feel free to reach out.
